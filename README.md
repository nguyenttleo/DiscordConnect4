# DiscordConnect4

Welcome to DiscordConnect4! This project allows users to play the classic game of Connect 4 with each other on Discord. The game logic is implemented in `game.py`, while the Discord bot automation is handled in `main.py`.

## Project Overview

DiscordConnect4 enables users to engage in a competitive game of Connect 4 on Discord. Connect 4 is a two-player game where the objective is to be the first to connect four of your colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the game board.

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.py`: This file automates the Discord bot to facilitate the game interactions and commands.
- `game.py`: This file contains the game logic and functions for Connect 4.
- `gameboard.txt`: This file represents the current state of the game board.
- `gamenumber.txt`: This file keeps track of the number of games played.
- `welcome.txt`: This file contains a welcome message for new players.
- `endgame.txt`: This file contains a message for the end of the game.
- `newboard.txt`: This file contains an empty Connect 4 board.

## How to Play

Connect 4 is played on a vertical grid of 6 rows and 7 columns. The game board is represented using emojis:

```
ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšªâšªâšªâšª
ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšªâšªâšªâšª
ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšªâšªâšªâšª
ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšªâšªâšªâšª
ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšªâšªâšªâšª
ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšªâšªâšªâšª
```

- Player 1 is represented by the red emoji (ðŸ”´), and Player 2 is represented by the white emoji (âšª).
- Players take turns dropping their colored discs into one of the seven columns.
- The disc will fall to the lowest available space in the selected column.
- The first player to connect four of their discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all columns are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
